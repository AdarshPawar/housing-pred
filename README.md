# housing-pred
Version 1.0 of the project is extremely simple and is used to recommend the best housing option for an individual.
It predicts one of four available housing options based on the needs of a given individual.
The data-set was collected using a survey and consists of 310 rows with 6 rows in a csv format.
This data-set was then formatted to remove blank spaces, convert them to numbers which is essential for the machine learing algortithm chosen.

Version 2.0 of the project increases the number of available housing option by a 4 fold to incroporate real world scenario.
Different algorithms are used for boosting the accuracy.
